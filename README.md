<h1 align="center">PryBar</h1>

## What is PryBar?
PryBar is a node module which allows you to programatically modify *some* very niche Expo-generated configuration files.
- `Info.plist`
- `build.gradle`
- `app/build.gradle`
- and `Podfile`

## Installation

Y'know, just use your favourite package manager!

```bash
npm i prybar     # ðŸŽ© A classic move!
yarn add prybar  # ðŸŽ‰ Convenience, and pretty emojis!
pnpm i prybar    # ðŸ˜¤ For hustlin' and bustlin'!
```

## Usage

```ts
// ...
import { withGradle, withPods, withCustomPlist } from "prybar";

const withPlugin: ConfigPlugin = (config) => {
  /**
   * Will add the dependencies, plugins, and repositories to the respective
   * build.gradle files.
   */
  withGradle(config, {
    dependencies: [`com.fullstory:gradle-plugin-local:1.27.1`],
    plugins: [{ name: "fullstory", options: { org: "o-XXX-XXXX } }],
    repositories: [{ name: "maven", url: "https://maven.fullstory.com" }],
  });
  
  /**
   * Will add the provided pods to the Podfile.
   */
  withPods(config, [
    {
      name: "FullStory",
      url: "https://ios-releases.fullstory.com/fullstory-1.27.1.tar.gz",
    }
  ]);
  
  /**
   * Will make the respective changes to the Info.plist file.
   */
  return withCustomPlist(config, [
    {
      key: "FullStory",
      value: { OrgId: "o-XXX-XXXX" },
    }
  ]);
};

export default withPlugin;
```
